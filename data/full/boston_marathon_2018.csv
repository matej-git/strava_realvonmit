For example, if you were to ride a 40k time trial in 60 minutes at an average power of 275&lt;abbr title=\'Watts\'&gt;W&lt;/abbr&gt;, your FTP would be 275W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTP is the keystone to training with power. It allows Strava to determine how hard a ride is for you. You doing 300W might feel much different than someone less trained doing 300W and FTP allows us to gauge just how hard segments, rides, and even weeks or months of training were for you!&lt;/p&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-calculating-ftp-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Calculating Your FTP&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend you test for your FTP at least every few weeks to a month while you&amp;#39;re training. Here are some tips to get the most out of your FTP testing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s extremely taxing on your body (and your training program) to continuously push out 60-minute max efforts. It&amp;#39;s also difficult to find a stretch of road where you can ride for 60 minutes uninterrupted and maintain a steady wattage. Thus, the easiest way to calculate your FTP is to test your best average power for 20 minutes. We believe 20 minutes is enough time to stress the same physiological systems as a 60-minute effort would and it is easier to consistently do within your season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try to reproduce the same conditions each test – this means use the same stretch of road or always use the same trainer/rollers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure you are fresh (the previous few days should be light in terms of training load)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Properly warm up&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-weighted-average-power-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Weighted Average Power&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you ride with a power meter, you&amp;#39;ll notice how your power jumps all over the place based on the terrain, grade, wind, and other factors. Weighted Average Power looks at all of this variation and provides an average power for your ride that is a better indicator of your effort than simply taking your average power. It is our best guess at your average power if you rode at the exact same wattage the entire ride.&lt;/p&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-total-work-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Total Work&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total Work, expressed in kilojoules (kJ), is simply the sum of the watts generated during your ride. There is a close 1–to–1 ratio with Total Work and Calories expended during a ride.&lt;/p&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-intensity-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Intensity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intensity is our way of showing how difficult a ride was as compared to your &lt;abbr title =\'Functional Threshold Power\'&gt;FTP&lt;/abbr&gt;. We look at your Weighted Average Power for the ride and compare it to your FTP. If your Weighted Average Power was 250&lt;abbr title=\'Watts\'&gt;W&lt;/abbr&gt; and your FTP 300&lt;abbr title=\'Watts\'&gt;W&lt;/abbr&gt;, the Intensity would be 83%. It\'s very possible to have an Intensity of over 100% if the ride was shorter than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endurance / Recovery Ride – 65% and lower&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moderate Ride – 65-80%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tempo Ride – 80-95%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time Trial or Race – 95-105%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short Time Trial or Race – 105% and higher&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-training-load-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Training Load&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We calculate Training Load by comparing your power during your ride to your &lt;abbr title=\'Functional Threshold Power\'&gt;FTP&lt;/abbr&gt; and determining how much load you put on your body during the workout. Training Load is a great way to determine how much rest you need after your workouts. The guide below will tell you how long after a workout it will take you to fully recover:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 24 hours – 125 and lower&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;36-48 hours – 125-250&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least 3 days – 250-400&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least 5 days – 400+&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-power-curve-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Power Curve&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Power Curve shows your best average power for time periods of 1 second up to the length of your ride. We search your entire ride and find these best efforts and you can compare them with your best efforts for your last 6 weeks, the current year, years in the past, or all-time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Power Curve can be displayed in Watts (W) or Watts per Kilogram (W/kg.)&lt;/p&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-power-zones-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Power Zones&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Power Curve shows your best efforts for given periods of time, Power Zone charts take each 1 second of power of your ride and put it into a bucket. The buckets are based on your &lt;abbr title=\'Functional Threshold Power\'&gt;FTP&lt;/abbr&gt; and are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Active Recovery – Social pace with very little physiological effect on your body. Can be used in between intervals and for recovery rides.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endurance – Easy pace that you could ride “all day long” Conversation is still possible with little concentration required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tempo – Brisk pace that can be maintained for a few hours that requires concentration when riding alone. Breathing in tempo is rhythmic and may become strained at the upper end of this zone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Threshold – Moderate to hard effort and leg fatigue that can be maintained for up to 1 hour. Conversation is difficult and concentration is required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VO2Max – Power that is primarily taxing your VO2Max system. Leg fatigue is high and conversation is not possible. VO2Max can be maintained for 3-8 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anaerobic – Extremely hard efforts with severe leg fatigue that can be maintained for 30 seconds to 3 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neuromuscular – Sprinting power that is taxing your neuromuscular system and can be maintained for 1-20 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-suffer-score-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Relative Effort&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative Effort is an analysis of your heart rate data. By tracking your heart rate through your workout and its level relative to your maximum heart rate, we attach a value to show exactly how hard you worked. The more time you spend going full gas and the longer your activity, the higher the score. Compare your Relative Effort with friends and pros, see if you can do a truly epic workout and motivate yourself to push that extra bit harder!

VAM is useful for comparing your effort on different hills and segments, and is used by both cyclists and runners. To get a high VAM score, grades between 6-10% generally present the best opportunity to ascend quickly, as they are steep enough to avoid wind, and gradual enough to allow unrestricted motion.&lt;/p&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-intensity-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Intensity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intensity is a measure that describes running activities on a 10-point scale, with race pace set to 10. The pace used to calculate the intensity takes into account the distance of the run and elevation gained and lost over the run. Now you can instantly gauge how tough your pace is for a run, and see if you&amp;#39;re slowing down enough on your recovery runs.&lt;/p&gt;</script><script id=""glossary-definition-segment-template"" type=""text/template"">&lt;h4&gt;Segments&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A segment is Strava&amp;#39;s term for a specific section of a road, climb or trail. Strava athletes can create segments from their uploaded activities. Strava tracks your performance on each segment every time you run or ride so you can see how you&amp;#39;re progressing over time, and compare your results with other athletes on Strava: your friends, local athletes and even the pros.

When running downhill, the Grade Adjusted Pace will be slower than the actual pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjustment generally becomes larger as the grade steepens. Our athletes\' data has shown that the downhill adjustment peaks around -10%, after which it becomes slightly less extreme. Note that GAP does not account for terrain differences or the technical difficulty of running downhill.

Usually done before or after a hard workout. Active recovery is also the pace runners jog at during the recovery intervals between harder efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endurance - Comfortable running. Sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;conversational&amp;quot; pace. This zone usually makes up the bulk of a runner&amp;#39;s mileage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tempo - This pace often matches the intensity of a Marathon, or up-tempo pace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Threshold - A pace that can be sustained for up to 60 minutes with some difficulty.
